✔️ Data Cleaning** – Handling missing values, duplicates, and formatting inconsistencies  
✔️ Statistical Analysis– Summary statistics and distribution analysis  
✔️ Data Visualization – Heatmaps, histograms, box plots, and correlation analysis  
✔️ Outlier Detection – Identifying anomalies in financial data  
✔️ Feature Engineering – Creating new variables to enhance predictions  

#Technologies Used  
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  
- scikit-learn (for data preprocessing)
